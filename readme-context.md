## Context

React Native is a framework by Facebook for building mobile apps. As the name suggests, it works along with React to facilitate the creation of mobile apps which are not "mobile web apps" or "hybrid apps". The idea is to find a happy medium between the conventional native app development and web development environments. There is a bit of a learning curve to React Native, especially if you're a fairly confident React or mobile developer - it can be frustrating to re-learn everything in the React Native paradigm. However, 'converts' are often pleased with the robust paradigm, availability of community support, and hospitable development environment.
