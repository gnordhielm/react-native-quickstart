## Context

React Native is a framework by Facebook for building mobile apps. As the name suggests, it works along with React to facilitate the creation of mobile apps which are not "mobile web apps" or "hybrid apps", but indistinguishable from iOS/Android apps written in C. The idea is to find a happy medium between the conventional native app development and web development environments. There is a bit of a learning curve to React Native, especially if you're a fairly confident React or mobile developer - it can be frustrating to re-learn everything in the React Native paradigm. However, 'converts' are often pleased with the robust paradigm, availability of community support, and hospitable development environment.

**Prerequisites**

The authors come from a web development background, so this guide will be most effective if you are comfortable working with the following technologies:

* Web dev fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
* Node and Express ([more](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/)).
* React ([more](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)).

>If you are new to web development in general, this guide is not the best place to start, I (Gus) would recommend you start with: (Michael Hartl's Learn Enough series)[https://www.learnenough.com/tutorials].
