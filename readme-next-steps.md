## Next Steps

At this point, you have all of the React Native requirements on your machine, a good hunk of code for reference, and a general understanding of how it works. You might want to complete a tutorial on your own:

* [A task manager](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-react-native-todo-application)
* [A chat app](https://blog.sendbird.com/tutorial-build-a-messaging-app-using-react-native/)

When you're ready (you might already be, who knows) you shouldn't waste any time getting your feet wet: build your own app! Keep the scope reasonable, make it something you'd like to use, and deploy it to the app store. Rinse and repeat.
